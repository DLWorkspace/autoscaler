## What's inside

[Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) - a component that automatically adjusts the size of a Kubernetes
Cluster so that all pods have a place to run and there are no unneeded nodes. Works with GCP, AWS and Azure. Version 1.0 (GA) was released with kubernetes 1.8.
